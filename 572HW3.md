    1. set up the user directoryon HDFS. `hadoopfs-mkdir-p/user/<yourusernamehere>`, get name run  `whoami`
    2. Set up environment variables for JAVA and HADOOP_CLASSPATH. Please note that this step has to be done each time you open a new SSH terminal.
       - JAVA_HOME is already set-up. Do not change this.
       - `exportPATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}`
       - ``export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar`
       - to ensure, run the command `env`
    3. Run `hadoop fs -ls`, no error ->  your cluster was successfully set up
    4. Click the top left button and go to the `Billing` section. Click the button next to the project you created initially, and select disable billing. Please do this whenever you are not working on the cluster.
